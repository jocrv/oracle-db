Oracle, spread
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

DML runs in parallel. Oracle runs on all different platforms.

I get atomic operations on each record, and each accesses in a way. DML operations in the data manipulation part, to run parallel to this.
About popularity, processing power: benchmark that compare with oracle because sql has an operating system limitation.
cost of oracle is 4 more than the ratio in microsoft of sql

ansi sql support: standard language for creating sqlans
